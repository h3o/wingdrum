This is the firmware source code for Wing Drum:

It is a free software (licensed under GPLv3), published for educational purposes and with a hope that it will be useful to someone.

The code should reliably compile against ESP-IDF version 4.4, we used commit a49e0180ee638e41876a8f7bc6428a983fc69d66 from 18/08/2023 08:33:19

Configuration for Eclipse IDE (2022-12) is included as an example of how the project was configured (you'll need to update it to make it work for you).
